Problem Definition                                                                                                                                 

The objective of our project is to build and deploy a chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the RASA framework, a popular open-source framework for building and deploying chatbots and conversational assistants. This project will serve as a valuable resource for individuals seeking support for emotional wellbeing. By leveraging the capabilities of RASA, we will develop a chatbot that can accurately understand user intents, extract relevant information, and generate appropriate responses.
This project focuses on the step-by-step processes involved in building a chatbot using RASA, such as data preprocessing, intent classification, entity recognition, dialogue management, and response generation. By implementing this, we intend to achieve the following objectives:
•	Understand the fundamental concepts of NLP and its relevance in chatbot development. 
•	Gain proficiency in using RASA framework for building and training chatbots. 
•	Explore different techniques for intent classification and entity recognition. 
•	Develop a robust dialogue management system to ensure a smooth flow of conversation.
•	Implement a response generation mechanism to provide accurate and contextually appropriate replies.

By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a functional chatbot that can intelligently understand user queries, offer relevant information or assistance, and engage in meaningful conversations as mental support system.
